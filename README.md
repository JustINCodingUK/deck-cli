# Deck CLI

Deck CLI is a lightweight, blazing-fast command-line tool for running Deck automation scripts - whether globally or per project. Powered by GraalVM native image and built with Kotlin, it’s optimized for simplicity, speed, and cross-platform consistency.


---

## ✨ Features

* Fast: Native image means instant startup, even for complex tasks

* Flexible: Run global scripts or project-specific automation

* Composable: Backed by deck-api, making it modular and extensible

* Asynchronous: Built with kotlinx.coroutines for smooth parallel execution



---

## 🛠️ Usage

* Run a script defined in a project-local .deckfile file inside project/.deck/scripts/
`deck project <script-name>`

* Run an independent .deckfile
`deck <script-name>`

Example:

`deck project ci         # Run the 'ci' task from .deck in current directory`
`deck setup              # Run setup.deckfile script`

## 📦 Tech Stack

* Deck API – modular DSL for defining tasks

* Kotlinx Coroutines – async power under the hood

* GraalVM Native Image – instant startup, tiny binary
